### Phase 1: Project Setup

```
- [x] Set up Rust development environment
- [x] Create a new Rust project
- [x] Add dependencies (reqwest, serde, etc.)
- [x] Configure OpenAI API key
- [x] Create project structure (main.rs, modules)
```

### Phase 2: Basic API Integration

```
- [ ] Write a function to format API requests
- [ ] Implement sending HTTP requests using reqwest
- [ ] Handle API responses and errors
```

### Phase 3: Initial Game State Setup

```
- [ ] Define data structures for game state
- [ ] Initialize game state variables (characters, inventory)
- [ ] Implement a function to update game state
```

### Phase 4: Player Input Handling

```
- [ ] Create a function to gather player input
- [ ] Validate and format player input
- [ ] Integrate player input into the game loop
```

### Phase 5: Storytelling Integration

```
- [ ] Parse AI responses for storytelling elements
- [ ] Create a function to manage storytelling output
- [ ] Display narrative to the player
```

### Phase 6: Function Calling System

```
- [ ] Define functions for character creation
- [ ] Define functions for inventory management
- [ ] Implement function calling based on AI responses
```

### Phase 7: Game Loop Development

```
- [ ] Implement the main game loop
- [ ] Integrate API request/response within the loop
- [ ] Update game state and storytelling within the loop
```

### Phase 8: Testing and Debugging

```
- [ ] Write unit tests for API integration
- [ ] Test game state updates
- [ ] Debug issues with player input handling
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end tests of the game loop
```

### Phase 9: Performance Optimization

```
- [ ] Optimize API request handling
- [ ] Improve game state update performance
- [ ] Minimize latency in storytelling display
```

### Phase 10: User Interface and Experience

```
- [ ] Design a basic user interface
- [ ] Implement user interface elements for input and output
- [ ] Test user interaction flow
```

### Phase 11: Finalization and Polishing

```
- [ ] Review and refine game mechanics
- [ ] Conduct final testing and bug fixing
- [ ] Prepare documentation and release notes
```

### Phase 12: Post-Release Support

```
- [ ] Monitor player feedback
- [ ] Plan for updates and feature additions
- [ ] Maintain and support the game post-release
```
