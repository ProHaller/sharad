### Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] ~Set up Rust development environment~
- [x] ~Create a new Rust project~
- [x] ~Add dependencies (reqwest, serde, etc.)~
- [x] ~Configure OpenAI API key~
- [x] ~Create project structure (main.rs, modules)~

### Phase 2: Basic API Integration

- [x] ~Write a function to format API requests~
- [x] ~Implement sending HTTP requests using reqwest~
- [x] ~Handle API responses and errors~

### Phase 3: Initial Game State Setup

- [ ] Define data structures for game state
- [ ] Initialize game state variables (characters, inventory)
- [ ] Implement a function to update game state

### Phase 4: Player Input Handling

- [x] ~Create a function to gather player input~
- [x] ~Validate and format player input~
- [x] ~Integrate player input into the game loop~

### Phase 5: Storytelling Integration

- [ ] Parse AI responses for storytelling elements
- [x] ~Create a function to manage storytelling output~
- [x] ~Display narrative to the player~

### Phase 6: Function Calling System

- [ ] Define functions for character creation
- [ ] Define functions for inventory management
- [ ] Implement function calling based on AI responses

### Phase 7: Game Loop Development

- [ ] Implement the main game loop
- [ ] Integrate API request/responsp within the loop
- [ ] Update game state and storytelling within the loop

### Phase 8: Testing and Debugging

- [ ] Write unit tests for API integration
- [ ] Test game state updates
- [ ] Debug issues with player input handling
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end tests of the game loop

### Phase 9: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize API request handling
- [ ] Improve game state update performance
- [ ] Minimize latency in storytelling display

### Phase 10: User Interface and Experience

- [x] ~Design a basic user interface~
- [ ] Implement user interface elements for input and output
- [x] ~Test user interaction flow~

### Phase 11: Finalization and Polishing

- [ ] Review and refine game mechanics
- [ ] Conduct final testing and bug fixing
- [ ] Prepare documentation and release notes

### Phase 12: Post-Release Support

- [ ] Monitor player feedback
- [ ] Plan for updates and feature additions
- [ ] Maintain and support the game post-release
